Future Work and Research Extensions

This project can be extended in several research directions:

1. Applying Drift Analysis to NLP Datasets

Distribution shift is common in text data as language, topics, and vocabulary change over time. The same methodology can be applied to NLP models to examine their robustness.

2. Monitoring Drift in Streaming Data

In real-world ML systems, data arrives continuously. This work can be expanded to simulate streaming data and build automated drift monitoring systems.

3. Automated Drift Alerts in Production

Using tools like Deepchecks, drift detection can be integrated into ML deployment pipelines to trigger alerts when model reliability declines.

4. Studying Label Shift vs. Covariate Shift

Further experiments can clarify the effects of changes in feature distribution compared to changes in label distribution.

5. Comparing More Robust Models

Future experiments can compare linear models, tree models, and neural networks for robustness when faced with drift.
